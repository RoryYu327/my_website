# Biden's Approval Margins

www.fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval]
(https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r fix date and calculate net approval rate, cache=TRUE}

# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(enddate = mdy(enddate))

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r net approval margin for Biden}

#tidy data and calculate CI using formula. We concentrate only on subgroup "voters"
net_approval <- approval_polllist %>% 
  filter(!is.na(subgroup), subgroup=="Voters") %>%
  #using lubridate to get week number
  mutate(week = isoweek(enddate),
         net_approval_day = approve - disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(mean_net_approval = mean(net_approval_day),
            sd_net_approval = sd(net_approval_day),
            count = n(),
            se_twitter = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            lower_ci =  mean_net_approval - t_critical*se_twitter,
            upper_ci = mean_net_approval + t_critical*se_twitter)
```

```{r Biden net approval rate plot, fig.align="center", fig.height=18, fig.width=26}
#plot Biden's weekly net approval rate
ggplot(net_approval, 
       aes(x= week, 
           y= mean_net_approval)) +
  geom_line(color = "red")+
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 1)+

              level = 0,

  #add orange line at zero
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, 
             color = "orange", 
             size = 2)+
  theme_minimal()+
  #add confidence band using calculated CI
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_ci, 
                  ymax = upper_ci),
              alpha=0.3,
              fill = "grey",
              color = "red") + 
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average approval of subgroup \"Voters\"",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin (approve-disapprove)")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-15,10,2.5), limits=c(-15,40))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,40,13))+
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 18),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 18),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size=22, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size=22, face="bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face="bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=20, face="bold")
  )+

```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 4` and `week 25`. 

```{r compare week 4 and 25 confidence intervals for approval rate}
net_approval_4_25 <- net_approval %>% 
  filter(week %in% c(4, 25)) %>% 
  mutate(
    ci_width = upper_ci - lower_ci) %>% 
  select(week, lower_ci, upper_ci, ci_width)

net_approval_4_25
  
```
> Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

From the results, we can clearly see that the confidence interval for Biden's net approval rate has been narrower from week 4 to week 25. The standard deviation in approval ratings is much larger in week 4 than in week 25, which generates a higher standard error and consequently a wider confidence interval. We assume this is because as after Biden has been elected for a longer period of time in week 25 (almost half a year), voters would become more clear about their approval or disapproval to the president. After Americans took over 25-week time to evaluate their newly elected president, they would probably have a clearer attitude towards Biden's policy changes, administration and national strategies. These clearer perceptions then result in this decreasing variance in approval ratings, consequently a lower standard deviation and ultimately more narrow confidence intervals.
