This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files.

# Headings

The following `<h1>`—`<h6>` elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level while `<h6>` is the lowest.

# Highest
## Second Highest
### Third Highest
#### Fourth level
##### Fifth level
###### Sixth level

# Paragraph

To include a paragraph, just add text and start writing.

# Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source.
> So this is a blockquote

## Blockquote without attribution

> This is also a blockquote.

## Blockquote with attribution

> This is another blockquote.
> — <Here goes the cite>
