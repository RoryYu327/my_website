<p>Jiangxia was born on 23rd October 1996. He was named after two provinces in China, Zhe<strong>Jiang</strong> and Ning<strong>Xia</strong>, one for his parents’ hometown and one for his birthplace.<br />
</p>
<p>After enrolled in UCL for his undergraduate degree, Jiangxia decides to name himself Rory because he had seen so many non-Mandarin speakers having trouble pronouncing his Chinese name.
During his time in UCL, Rory had courses in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Economics</p></li>
<li><p>Econometrics</p></li>
<li><p>Programming</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After graduating from UCL, Rory decided to take a gap year because of the <em>pandemic</em>. During the gap year, Rory worked on two internships in one security company and one Big 4 consultancy. More details can be found on Rory’s <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/roryyu">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
